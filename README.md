# Overview

I created this Expense Tracker software as a learning project to deepen my understanding of the Java programming language. This project aims to demonstrate my proficiency in core Java concepts and provide a practical application that can be useful for managing personal expenses.

The purpose of this software is to allow users to input, view, and analyze their daily expenses. It provides a user-friendly command-line interface for easy interaction, making it a practical tool for anyone who wants to track their spending habits.

# Development Environment

I developed this software using the NetBeans Integrated Development Environment (IDE). NetBeans offers a user-friendly interface and strong support for Java development, making it an excellent choice for this project.

- **IDE:** NetBeans
- **Programming Language:** Java

# Useful Websites

During the development of this project, I found the following websites helpful for reference and learning:

- [Oracle Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/): Official Java documentation is a valuable resource for understanding Java's core concepts and libraries.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): A great community for asking and finding answers to programming-related questions. I often found solutions and insights here.

# Future Work

As I continue to learn and refine my software engineering skills, there are several areas I plan to address in the future:

- **Data Validation:** Implement robust data validation to handle user input errors gracefully.
- **Enhanced Reporting:** Develop more advanced reporting and analysis features to provide users with deeper insights into their expenses.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Create a graphical user interface for a more user-friendly and visually appealing experience.

This project is an ongoing learning journey, and I'm excited to explore more advanced Java concepts and further enhance the functionality and usability of this Expense Tracker in the future.
